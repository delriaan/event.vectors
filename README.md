# Event Vector Space

_event.vector.space_ is an R6 class object that creates a temporally-compared space of "event vectors", each comprised of a 'from' and 'to' date. 

The time between these events is the focus of derivation: properly, the event vector is a complex number that encodes the relationship between the boundaries of the events, thus allowing one to describe this relationship in a concise manner.
