)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Logical expression that retain graph edges meeting the conditions}

\item{time.control}{A 2-element list containing the minimum and maximum values allowed for total temporal span between two events}

\item{graph.control}{An expression list containing \code{\link[igraph]{igraph-package}} calls to manipulate the internally-created graph in the order provided.  Use symbol \code{g} to generically denote the graph}

\item{omit.na}{(logical | FALSE) \code{TRUE} removes rows from class member \code{space} that have \code{NA} values}

\item{chatty}{(logical | FALSE) Verbosity flag}

\item{evs}{An \code{EVSpace} object}
}
\value{
Invisibly, the original object augmented with new member \code{space}
}
\description{
\code{make.evs_universe} supplies values to two class fields: \code{q_graph} and \code{space}, the latter being created from the former.
}
\section{Class Member \code{$space}}{

\code{$space} should have as many rows as the sum of all edge counts for graphs in \code{$q_graph}
}

\section{Parallelism}{

Parallelism over \code{$q_graph} is supported via \code{\link[furrr]{future_map}}.  The user is responsible for setting a \code{\link[future]{plan}}.
